## Instructions to Build/Run

*This is my personal website, so I won't be accepting edits. But if you were to try and run it locally:*
1. Clone this repository on the *main branch* (The deployment-branch is optimized for Github Pages):
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/mm-bertoni/Margaret_Bertoni_Site.git
	```
2. Ensure you have the packages from package.json
 
3. Run a reload or http-server and open the site on your local port. 

## AI Usage
This README.md was initially generated with the assitance of Github Copilot andG GPT-4.1. I Then edited it (including adding details on the AI Usage) to add more detail. The original prompt was: 
*Help me to write a README using the following class guidelines: Clear and descriptive README including: * Author * Class Link * Project Objective * Screenshot * Instructions to build *AI Usage    and any other guidelines found on the class site: https://johnguerra.co/classes/webDevelopment_online_fall_2025/*


The Academic Experience page was vibecoded per the project instructions. I used the following prompts: 
*As a full stack engineer, help me develop a create way to display information about my High School, Undergrad and Masters Education using only Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Hold off on coding for now while we develop an approach*

*I want to highlight the years of attendance, degree description, activities done, and classes.*

*I want to use the card flip/reveal approach using only CSS, Javascript, HTML5 and Bootstrap*

*want them to flip independently. Just one comprehensive class list. High school is North Carolina School of Science and Math. Undergrad is MIT. Masters is Northeastern. Can use those colors for each of the cards*

*build the structure and I can fill in the degree details later*

*separate into three files, one html, one css one for javascript. Also ensure that when the cards are flipped, the text doesnt over run (or enable scrolling so the text is readable)*

*update to not use <link href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css" rel="stylesheet">*

I used the code generated for the academic.html, style_vibecoded.css, and academic_vibecoded.js files. I then went through and edited them. I added the relevant school information. I changed the content of the cards to include awards as well. I removed any javascript or css that I didn't understand. 

My icon was generated with Adobe Illustrator's GenAI "Generative Vectors" function. I used the prompts:
*Initials MB*

*Initials MB Blue Background*
